    "- Submit your assignments to the corresponding assignment link in https://odtuclass.metu.edu.tr.\n",
    "- Solutions should be submitted in a single **ipynb** file named: metu-username_HW_2.ipynb (e.g., “e123456_HW_2.ipynb”).\n",
    "- Late submissions will be accepted by December 7, 2021 at 23:59 with a 5% per day penalty.\n",
    "- Do not change variable names in the code blocks and the texts in the markdowns.\n",
    "- **It is an individual assignment. You have to adhere to academic integrity principles.**\n",
    "- You are supposed to be able to interpret your findings. Hence, you shouldn't just find a number or result and just leave it. You need to comment on your findings by giving as much as **necessary** details.  \n",

    "A university professor was giving online lectures instead of face-to-face classes due to Covid-19. Later, he uploaded recorded lectures to the cloud for students who follow the course asynchronously (the students who did not attend the lesson but later watch the records). However, he believes that the students who attend class at the class time and participate in the process are more successful. Therefore, he recorded the average grades of the students at the end of the semester. The data is below.  \n",
